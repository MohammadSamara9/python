# Python Practice Repository

This repository contains my Python practice files.  
I use it to learn and review Python concepts such as:
- Variables and data types
- Loops and conditions
- Functions
- Lists and other data structures
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, etc.)

## How to Use
You can clone the repository and run any `.py` file:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MohammadSamara9/python.git
